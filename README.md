# Advent of Code 2022 to learn rust
This repo is just my code as I work through [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) in order to learn rust.

I was urged not to do this yet, to instead go back and walk through [rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings) and to read [the book](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn). I certainly might do that, I too often confuse `rustc` for `cargo build` and make trivial errors. Yet, I am largely up and running, and [the Primeagen](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen) recently suggested advent of code is a great way to begin to learn a new (ternary) language in [How to Learn A New Programming Language](https://youtu.be/E8cM12jRH7k). Further in the rust discord several people over the past week suggested _Advent of Code_ as a good way to learn the language. None of this means that working through _rustlings_ and taking time to read _the book_ is not worht my time, but I would like to see how far I will go before wanting to come back and find the kernels of knowledge I wish I knew earlier. :)
